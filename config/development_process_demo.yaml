# Development Process State Machine Configuration - Demo Version
# Implements the complete software development lifecycle as defined in process.md
# This version automatically completes after review for demonstration purposes

# All possible states in the development process
states:
  - waiting                 # Initial state, waiting to start
  - research               # Deep research, website analysis, competitor analysis
  - product_design         # Requirements analysis, user stories, use cases, domain model
  - backlog               # Product owner manages feature backlog
  - architecture          # Architect updates system architecture
  - test_planning         # Tester creates test plans
  - module_design         # Developer updates module and function descriptions
  - implementation        # Developer updates function implementations
  - uiux_design          # UX Designer creates UI/UX designs
  - frontend_dev         # Frontend Developer implements UI
  - testing              # Tester executes test plans
  - demo                 # Team demonstrates completed features
  - review               # Product Owner reviews and accepts/rejects
  - completed            # Final state - work accepted

# Events that trigger state transitions
events:
  - start               # Initialize the development process
  - work_done          # Work completed in current state
  - more_work_needed   # Review indicates more work is needed
  - accepted           # Work is accepted and complete
  - error              # Error occurred during processing
