## Research Output

### Game Overview
Mastermind is a classic deductive logic game where players try to guess a secret code created by the game. It is a two-player game, with one player acting as the "codemaker" and the other as the "codebreaker". The codemaker sets a secret code, and the codebreaker attempts to guess the code through a series of trial-and-error attempts.

### Core Functionality
**Primary Game Loop:** The core gameplay loop in Mastermind consists of the following steps:
1. The codemaker sets a secret code, which is a sequence of colored pegs.
2. The codebreaker makes a guess by arranging a row of colored pegs.
3. The codemaker provides feedback on the guess, indicating how many pegs are the correct color and in the correct position (black pegs), and how many are the correct color but in the wrong position (white pegs).
4. The codebreaker uses this feedback to refine their next guess, trying to narrow down the secret code.
5. The game continues with the codebreaker making guesses and the codemaker providing feedback until the codebreaker correctly guesses the secret code.

**Essential Mechanics:**
1. **Code Creation:** The codemaker sets a secret code, which is a sequence of colored pegs (typically 4 pegs in a row).
2. **Guessing:** The codebreaker arranges a row of colored pegs to make a guess at the secret code.
3. **Feedback:** The codemaker provides feedback on the guess, indicating the number of pegs that are the correct color and in the correct position (black pegs), and the number of pegs that are the correct color but in the wrong position (white pegs).
4. **Deduction:** The codebreaker uses the feedback to deduce the secret code, making more informed guesses in subsequent rounds.

**Player Actions:**
- Codemaker: Set the secret code, provide feedback on the codebreaker's guesses.
- Codebreaker: Make guesses at the secret code, interpret the feedback provided by the codemaker.

**System Interactions:** The core interaction in Mastermind is between the codemaker and the codebreaker. The codemaker's feedback on the codebreaker's guesses directly informs the codebreaker's next move, creating a back-and-forth deductive process.

**Progression Elements:** The game progresses as the codebreaker makes successive guesses, with the goal of correctly identifying the secret code within a limited number of attempts (typically 10-12 guesses). The game can be played repeatedly, with the codemaker and codebreaker switching roles.

**Feedback Systems:** The primary feedback in Mastermind is the codemaker's response to the codebreaker's guesses, indicating the number of correct and partially correct pegs. This feedback directly shapes the codebreaker's next move, creating a sense of progression and discovery as they narrow down the secret code.

### Technical Implementation
Mastermind can be implemented on a variety of platforms, from physical board games to digital versions. The core technical requirements include:
- A user interface that allows the codemaker to set the secret code and the codebreaker to make guesses.
- A system to track the number of guesses and provide feedback on each guess.
- Efficient data structures and algorithms to manage the game state and logic.
- Potential additional features like a timer, scoring system, or difficulty settings.

The primary technical challenge is ensuring the game logic is robust and responsive, providing a smooth and intuitive experience for both players.
